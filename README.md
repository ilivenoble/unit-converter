## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learnt to use the toFixed() method in Javascript to round numbers to specified decimal places.

e.g

```javascript
massResult.innerHTML = `${myNumber} kilos = ${kiloTopounds.toFixed(3)} pounds | ${myNumber} pounds = ${poundsTokilo.toFixed(3)} kilos`
```
Also, I applied my knowledge of making a div centered in CSS using:

```css
 div {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
### Continued development
I plan to make this Unit Converter reponsive by adding some Responsive Design principles like:
- Media Queries.
- CSS Units like rem amd em.

once I learn them.


### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) - This helped me to know better about CSS, particularly in centering a div vertically and horizontally. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freedcodecamp.com) - This is   where I learned basics of HTML and CSS before undertaking Scrimba's Front End Career path. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concepts.
